                Across the Obelisk is a coop RPG deckbuilding roguelite. Play solo or with your friends, choose your heroes, unlock items and 
                cards, craft your deck and face powerful enemies in deep tactical combat. Would you dare to go across the obelisk?
                <br> 
                <br>
                Choose among 16 characters and form your party. Each one of them have his own cards, items, mechanics, stats and strengths... 
                it's not the same to play with a fire wizard than a shadow mage, would you play with two healers or rather 
                play with a damage oriented group? Would you dare to go across the obelisk? 
                <br>
                <br>
                More than 500 upgradeable cards and 200 items to choose, will let you customize your heroes with different builds: poisons, 
                bleeds, defensive skills... there are a lot of combinations that you can apply to each hero. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Each game will be different. Take a path, fight your way through it, complete quests and the world will evolve in front of you. 
                Lots of hidden places and mysteries to be solved await you in Across the Obelisk.

        "Overall, Across the Obelisk is a fun deckbuilding roguelite that doesn't measure up to the genre's greats. 
        Its innovations aren't really that interesting and the rest is pretty standard, which isn't a knock against the 
        game, since it executes on that vanilla approach well. It does mean that Across the Obelisk is less likely to 
        suck players into dozens of hours of playthroughs, but it's worth a try for fans of the deckbuilding roguelite 
        genre. I can't see myself going back right now when Slay the Spire and Roguebook offer much more depth, but I 
        enjoyed my stay with Across the Obelisk, and if there are any major updates, I'll get my party back together for 
        another journey."

            "Across the Obelisk falls just shy of the modern deck-building genre’s defining hits, but holds its own in 
            an increasingly crowded field. It can struggle to keep pace with itself at times, but you should check it 
            out if Dungeons & Dragons meets Slay the Spire sounds at all appealing. Coming to understand and master the 
            gameplay is great fun, particularly as you tweak your creations and internalize the game’s nuances. Just be 
            prepared to deal with its many systems and status effects.""
