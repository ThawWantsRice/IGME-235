        <h2>About the development of the experience</h2>
        <p>
            This project did not turn out the way i wanted, and i can only blame myself for the lack of effort regarding it.
            The game as display above was suppose to be a quick paced puzzle game that was supposed to challenge the user to try to keep up with the orders given
            out by the customers. I definitely did not give myself enough time to work on the project and make it as I foresaw it as. The code is not working
            as the cards the customers want do not interact with the cards that you own currently making it just a game that doesn't work. For the project itself I tried
            make just the action of picking the customer's card the priority, but I couldn't get the interaction to work out. SO I do have the board cards and the Above cards in there
            respective places, but just no interaction between them.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the things I do have I tried to make it look good and pleasing. The cards are well even out with good designs for both the front and
            back of the cards. The table where the cards you own is well space to fit like a pop up shop stall and when the player interacts with the cards and audio clip is
            played to let the player know of the interaction. At all times some background Music is playing to give the player a sense of belonging in the scene. The HTML and CSS is
            valid and the code conventions follow what was asked I hope. I made an ES6 class for the cards themselves to allow for ease of use.
